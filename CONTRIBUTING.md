# Contributing to ABMS
I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Develop with Github
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## I Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL v3 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project. Feel free to contact if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/saiarlen/arlen-blog-management-system-for-html-sites/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!


**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

* Use a Consistent Coding Style
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
